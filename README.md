# Registration-Form-Development

This code constitutes a user registration form comprising HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure defines two forms, one for login and another for registration, enclosed in a wrapper. CSS styling, using the Poppins font, creates an aesthetically pleasing layout with animated transitions. Input fields, labels, and icons are styled for an interactive user experience. The JavaScript component enables form switching, toggling the 'active' class on the wrapper when the "Sign Up" or "Login" links are clicked. This dynamic behavior ensures a seamless transition between the login and registration sections, enhancing the overall user interaction and visual appeal of the registration form.
